   - Deployed simple flask app and p0 project onto droplet
   - Referred to instructions here: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-flask-application-on-an-ubuntu-vps
   - Followed Karl.SeniorMars's tips in #dev_discussion channel about the wsgi file and permissions changes
   - chmod -R ugo+w app (changed all groups to have write permissions in the app folder and all files inside it)
   - in app.wsgi added: `sys.path.append("/var/www/legendary-bassoon/app/")` after `sys.path.insert(0,"/var/www/legendary-bassoon/")`
   - in __init__.py, when inputting the database path, `/var/www/legendary-bassoon/app/fruit_for_blogs.db` was used (absolute path) instead of        `fruit_for_blogs.db` (relative path)

   - added Bootstrap to login_or_register.html:
   	- add background image that covers the entire page without the image repeatedly displayed as tiles 
	- group text and buttons inside <div> tags with different padding, margin, and col-<number> values to organize elements
	- adjusted font and background color of heading and login and register buttons to contrast with background.
