   - Followed Karl.SeniorMars's tips in #dev_discussion channel about the wsgi file and permissions changes
        - chmod -R ugo+w app (changed all groups to have write permissions in the app folder and all files inside it)
        - in app.wsgi added: `sys.path.append("/var/www/legendary-bassoon/app/")` after `sys.path.insert(0,"/var/www/legendary-bassoon/")`
        - in __init__.py, when inputting the database path, `/var/www/legendary-bassoon/app/fruit_for_blogs.db` was used (absolute path) instead of `fruit_for_blogs.db` (relative path)

    - Added Bootstrap to login_or_register.html:
       	- Added background image that covers the entire page without the image repeatedly displayed as tiles
    	- Grouped text and buttons inside <div> tags with different padding, margin, and col-<number> values to organize elements
    	- Adjusted font and background color of heading and login and register buttons to contrast with background.

    - Increased the resolution of the background image of login_or_register.html with an image editor.
    - Uploaded background images of login_or_register.html, register.html, and login.html into the static folder in team repo.
    - Added Bootstrap to register.html and login.html:
        - Organized input fields and text by grouping them inside <div> tags
        - Adjusted margin, padding, and col-<positive #> class values until the elements were centered and the edges of text
        and input fields lined up
        - Used a color scheme that makes text easy to read and corresponds to the colors of login and register buttons on login_or_register.html

    - Fixed "Bad Request: The browser (or proxy) sent a request that this server could not understand" error that was rendered on register.html
    and login.html after the user clicked a button to submit info.  This problem was solved by adding a name attribute inside <input> tags
    with the same value as key in request.form[<key>] commands in __init__.py

    - Displayed error on login.html when users type incorrect username/password in bold red text, centered, at the top of the page,
    and highlighted with a white background that contrasts with green background image covering the entire page.

    - Added Bootstrap to home.html
    - Removed unnecessary CSS from view_blogs.html and other_blog.html
    - Adjusted header in view_blogs.html and other_blog.html to include a log out button on the right

    - Adjusted margin, padding, and width values to prevent the HTML form's input fields from covering text when the user 
    decreases the size of the register.html page. 
    - Set the value of the background-attachment attribute to fixed, min-width to 100%, and min-height to 100% 
    so that the background image covers the entire page when the user zooms in/out or scrolls down the page.
    - Changed background image and button and text colors of register.html to fit the website's color scheme of blue, green, and white.
